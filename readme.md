There I used Node, Express, Ejs for backend and basic html cssfor frontend.

For creating a RESTful APIs ..>

GET             /posts          ..to take data from frontend
POST            /posts          ..to add or upload a new post
GET             /posts:id       ..to get the specific content of this id
PUT or PATCH    /posts:id       ..to update the content
DELETE          /posts:id       ..to delete the content
